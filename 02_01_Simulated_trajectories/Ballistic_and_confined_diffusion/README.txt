These data simulate the behaviour of the particle that is diffusing within a confinement, which, in turn, ballistically moves in a certain direction.

The dimensions of the confinement are randomly chosen from the linear space of [0,1], [0,3], or [0,6] a.u. along each of the axes. 

The coordinates of the vector of the ballistic movement are randomly chosen from the linear space of [0, 0.001], [0.001,0.01], or [0.01,0.1] a.u.
