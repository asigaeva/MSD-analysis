In this case, the trajectory is built as a sum of ballistic movement and random walk.
For each individual file, the vector of the ballistic velocity (both the direction and the magnitude) is calculated, based on the three randomly chosen displacements (one for X, Y and Z). The set of possible displacements is defined as a linear space of 1000 numbers between -0.5 and +0.5 a.u.
